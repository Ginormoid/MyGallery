<p class="one">Mudcloth is made out of thin strips of woven cotton, stitched together to produce a fine piece of cloth. The patterns and symbols on the cloth are printed manually by hand using various natural dyes from plants. Originally men were responsible to weave the fabrics together to create the cloth while women do all strenuous dyeing process. Now let’s go to the dyeing procedure.</p>
<p>At first, the leaves and branches are put in a bath where the woven cotton is dyed. This gives the cloth a yellowish hue which is then spread out in the sun and decorated with dark mud. The mud for decorating the cloth is mixed with water and other substances, it’s then left to ferment for a year before it is used. After some time, the mud turns gray and any excess mud is removed. They difficulty of making mudcloth arises from the removing and application mud to the dyed fabric/cloth, usually done repeatedly until the areas with mud becomes permanently dark. A bleach is applied to the yellow areas and left in the sun to turn the areas brown after which any excess bleach is removed. The output is a vibrant and attractive pattern showing white on a dark surrounding of cloth.</p>
<p>In the early day hunters wore it ritually for protection and to show status. The cloth was wrapped around women immediately after childbirth. It is said to have the power to deflect bad spirits and absolve pain. The symbols on the mudcloth contains so many mysteries which are known within particular communities and unknown to outsiders.</p>
